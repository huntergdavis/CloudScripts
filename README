This is a set of scripts for cloud server management

uses RSCURL from https://github.com/jsquared/rscurl
uses AWS from http://timkay.com/aws/


Example - Create a server on rackspace and lock it down so that only the passed-in ssh key will work and only for rackspace-user account

# First make sure you have your rackspace username and api key exported like
export RACKSPACE_USERNAME=yourusername
export RACKSPACE_API_KEY=yourapikey

# make sure you have yourSSHkey.key and yourSSHkey.pub 
# now create the server and lock it down like so
./create-server.sh -n yourservername -s rackspace -k yourSSHkey
